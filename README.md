===========
Welcome to the cortical.io-Public repository!

This is the public repository of [cortical.io](http://www.cortical.io/).
In the near future you will find the following items on this repository:

<UL>
<LI><B>Client-SDK:</B> Language bindings for Java, Javascript, Python, etc.</LI>
<LI><B>Samples:</B> Sample-code that makes your life easier and gets you started.</LI>
<LI><B>UI-Widgets:</B> Embeddable user interface components to adapt and use in your applications.</LI>

For the moment, the repository contains something we are really excited about: the Numenta Nupic Spring 2014 Hackathon demonstration code, which demonstrates the combination of cortical.io's Retina and Numenta's Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA).
