Welcome to the CEPT-Public repository!

This is the public repository of [CEPT Systems](http://www.cept.at/).
In the near future you will find the following items on this repository:

<UL>
<LI><B>Client-SDK:</B> Language bindings for Java, Javascript, Python, etc.</LI>

For the moment, the repository contains something we are really excited about: the Numenta Nupic Spring 2014 Hackathon demonstration code, which demonstrates the combination of CEPT's Retina and Numenta's Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA).
