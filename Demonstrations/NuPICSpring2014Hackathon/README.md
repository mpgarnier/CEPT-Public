# Numenta Spring 2014 Hackathon Contribution

This is the demonstration code of CEPT's contribution to the Numenta Spring 2014 Hackathon. 

### Overview
The code demonstrates how Numenta's Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) and CEPT's Retina can be combined to
form a small nimble fast-learning entity that figures out that actors and singers like fans and physicists and
mathematicians are (surprisingly) more interested in mathematics.
We think that this is great demonstration of what is possible through the combination of these two systems.



### Prerequisites
In order to run the code you will have to install Nupic.
Detailed installation instruction are available [here](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Installing-and-Building-NuPIC).
Further you will need to have Python 2.7 or higher installed.


### Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with the demonstration code is to import it as a PyDev project.
The abstraction.py file holds the code used to conduct the Hackathon experiments.
The experiments can easily be extended by adding additional training sentences or queries.
Even without making any changes to the code, this should be a great way to further explore the potential of the 
CEPT-CLA combination. This sample code demonstrates what we came up with under the time constraints of a Hackathon.
We are very excited to further explore the potential of this, and we hope others will be too.

If you have further questions, suggestions, or run into problems trying to set up the demonstration code feel free to contact us
